Let's consider a square grid with N rows and N columns, both numbered 1 through N. Each cell contains one integer. Let ri denote the minimum value in the i-th row, and let Ci denote the maximum value in the i-th column. A grid is called nice if and only if the following condition holds true:
max(r1, r2, ..., rN) = min(C1, C2, ..., CN)
Chef has a square grid and can change some of its elements (numbers in the cells). Find the minimum possible number of elements Chef should change, so that the new grid is nice.
An element can be changed to any integer.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N, denoting the size of the grid.

The following N lines describe the grid. The i-th of those lines contains N integers, denoting the numbers in the i-th row.

Output
Print one integer, denoting the minimum number of changes required to make the grid nice
