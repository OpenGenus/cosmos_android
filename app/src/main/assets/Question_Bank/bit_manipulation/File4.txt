You are given n positive integers A={a[1],a[2]...a[n]} and a integer S. You have to find weather there exist a non-empty subset of A whose sum i greater than or equal to S.
You have to print the size of minimal subset whose sum is greater than or equal to S.If there exist no such subset then print -1 instead.
Input- First line will comtain an integer,N ,which is the size of list. A second line contains n spaced integers representing the elemnts of list A.
Output- Print the size of the minimal subset whose sum is greater than or equal to S, if there is no such subset then print -1.
